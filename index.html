    <p>Playing Madden allows me to enjoy football in a virtual environment. It's fun to compete and improve my skills with each game.</p>

    <p>I got into playing Madden after my friends and I played together during high school. Since then, I've been enjoying learning new ways to play the game, as well as learning about the players so that I can follow football more closely.</p>
